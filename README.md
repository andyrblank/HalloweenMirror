# HalloweenMirror
This code is for reading a PIR sensor with a Raspberry Pi GPIO and upon being triggered playing a video from a list at random in VLC. The intended purpose is to play Halloween videos in a Smart Mirror while keeping the Terminal/Console clear of any text or blinking cursors that would take away from the effect.
